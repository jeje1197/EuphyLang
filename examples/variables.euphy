// In EuphyLang, you can create variables with static or dynamic-typing


// If a variable is declared with a type, it will only accept values of that type
string str = "A string"

// Invalid code below (Uncomment to observe error)
// str = 24


// Use the dynamic keyword to create variables with types that can change throughout the program
dynamic myVar = "A string"
print(myVar)

myVar = 24
print(myVar)
